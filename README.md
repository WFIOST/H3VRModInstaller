# H3VRModInstaller 

## Notice:
So, unfortunately, we (@Potatoes1286 and @Frityet) have decided to stop working and maintaining Mod Installer.
what this means for you, is basically mods on Mod Installer will stop updating, and new mods will not be added.
we're very sorry about this. we wish we could've brought you a longer lasting, better mod installer, but there's a few reasons why we've decided to stop working on it. if you still want to use a  mod installer, we recommend using nrgill28's Deli Counter. https://github.com/Deli-Collective/DeliCounter/releases/tag/v1.1.0

The first reason is motivation. We have lost the vast majority of our motivation to continue working on H3VRMI, and has begun to take a toll on our mental health.

Secondly, H3VRMI has outgrown far beyond our capabilities. We do not have any formal training at all in programming, and in fact, this was our first proper software we've developed. While the code beyond it still performed much better than we expected of our calibre, the database for H3VRMI and the frontend (UI), is an unmaintainable mess. A good portion of this being due to the fact we've developed, added, and patched on new features over months.
Once again, we're very sorry about this. We hope you all have better luck in the future with modding H3VR.
