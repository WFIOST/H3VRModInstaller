They are NOT required to play Sofia, but will add more variety to the weapon pools:\nModulAR:  https://bonetome.com/h3vr/weapons/159/ \nMeat’s ModulAR Parts:  https://bonetome.com/h3vr/weapons/157/ \nModulM4:  https://bonetome.com/h3vr/weapons/188/ \nModulSR:  https://bonetome.com/h3vr/weapons/167/\nOutbreak Perfected:  https://bonetome.com/h3vr/weapons/111/ \nHalo: Basic Infantry Weapons:  https://bonetome.com/h3vr/weapons/153/ \nMk14 EBR:  https://bonetome.com/h3vr/weapons/169/ \nTavor 21:  https://bonetome.com/h3vr/weapons/135/\nDesert \nTech MDR:  https://bonetome.com/h3vr/weapons/144/ \nAr-57:  https://bonetome.com/h3vr/weapons/143/ \nF2000 Tactical:  https://bonetome.com/h3vr/weapons/118/",

BUT, you can totally LARP as John Wick with this new TNH character: John Wurst!!! \nJohn Wurst's weapon pools ONLY include guns that John Wick has used in the movies. When you buy a gun from the supply room, it will come kitted out exactly like it was in the movie when John used it.\nAdditionally, custom sosigs have been created to mirror the kinds of enemies that John faces in the three movies. Early sosigs, for example, will be unarmored and have pistols only. But beware the final holds when the High Table enforcers kick in the door.\nREQUIRES TNHTWEAKER 1.4 OR HIGHER!\nSeveral modded guns are required for this character:\n- ModulAR https://bonetome.com/h3vr/weapons/159/\n- Meat's ModulARParts https://bonetome.com/h3vr/weapons/157/\n- Meat's ModulMPX https://bonetome.com/h3vr/weapons/187/ (Add “Evo3” to your magazine blacklist in your TNHTweaker folder if you want the MPX to spawn with MPX mags instead of Evo3 mags.)\n- Potato’s Compiled Custom Guns https://bonetome.com/h3vr/weapons/142/",
